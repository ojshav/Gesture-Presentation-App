# Gesture Presentation App using OpenCV

Welcome to the Gesture Presentation App README! This application allows users to control presentation slides using hand gestures captured via a webcam. The app is built using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python.

## Features

- Forward Gesture: Move to the next slide.
- Backward Gesture: Move to the previous slide.
- Pointer Gesture: Activate the pointer mode to move the cursor.
- Marker Gesture: Activate the marker mode to draw on the slides.
- Undo Gesture: Undo the last drawing action.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gesture-presentation-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd gesture-presentation-app
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```
    python gesture_presentation_app.py
    ```

2. Position yourself in front of the webcam.

3. Perform gestures to control the presentation:
    - Move your hand forward to move to the next slide.
    - Move your hand backward to move to the previous slide.
    - Make a pointing gesture to activate the pointer mode.
    - Make a grabbing gesture to activate the marker mode.
    - Perform an undo gesture to undo the last drawing action.

4. To exit the application, press stop the program.
